        <h2>C#</h2>
        <h3><i>I've used C# since around the middle of 2020. It's been quite the journey. I've made Optix Optimizer with some others, and I've also made some other projects, like a web browser based on the WebKit2 framework. I've stopped developing C# because the limitations for Linux.</i></h3>

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <h3><i>I've always wanted to make websites that look cool and have some use. Then I thought of a website where I'd put all my projects on. Then the first version of this site was born. I began using WordPress, and later quickly switched to HTML and CSS.</i></h3>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <h3><i>Just like HTML, I started learning CSS after learning the basics of HTML. It will however, cost a lot of time till I can call myself good at CSS. I am currently learning some more advanced things like animations and keyframing.</i></h3>
